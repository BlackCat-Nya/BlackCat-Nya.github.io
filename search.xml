<p>Lie brackets is a way to construct new vector fields $[X,Y]$ from existing vector fields $X$ and $Y$. It has some basic and common properties. Naturality is a significant property of Lie brackets. Also has it <strong><em>Jacobi identity</em></strong> $[X,[Y,Z]] + [Y,[z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0 $ and another identity $[fX,gY] = fg[X,Y] + (fXg)Y - g(Yf)X $. </p>
<p>There is a extemely useful coordinate formula for Lie brackets</p>
<div id="refer-thm1"></div>
$$[X,Y] = (XY^i - YX^i)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}.$$ 

<p>To check this, it is just a formal routine.</p>
<p><strong><big>The Lie Algebra of a Lie group</big></strong></p>
<p>Lie brackets lead to an important concept, the Lie algebra of a Lie group $G$. Let us notice that $\forall g \in G$, $g$ can be adapted to become a diffeomorphism by left translation $L_g(h) = gh$. The smooth vector fields on $G$ that is <strong><em>left-invariant</em></strong> form a linear subspace of $\mathfrak{X}(G)$. Moreover, this subspace is closed under Lie brackets  since there is the naturality $L_g[X,Y] = [L_gX , L_g Y]$ as $L_g$ is a diffeomorphism. </p>
<p>Then we give a general definition. A <strong><em>Lie algebra</em></strong> (over $\mathbb{R}$) is a real vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ endowed with a map called bracket from $\mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g}$ to $\mathfrak{g}$, $(X,Y) \mapsto [X,Y]$, that satisfies <em>bilinearity</em>, <em>antisymmetry</em> and <em>Jacobi identity</em>. A <strong><em>Lie algebra homomorphism</em></strong> is a homomorphism preserving brackets. The above example is obviously a Lie algebra, which is called the Lie algebra of $G$, usually denoted by $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. Infact, this vector space is finite-dimensional and with dimension equal to $G$. This can be proved by evaluation map $\epsilon : \mathrm{Lie}(G) \rightarrow T_\epsilon G$, given by $\epsilon(X) = X_e$, using the fact that the left multiplication is transitive. A global frame of $G$ is called a <strong><em>left-invariant frame</em></strong>. </p>
<p>The Lie algebra of $\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{S}^1$ and $\mathbb{T}^n$ is abelian. And generally Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of abelian Lie group $G$ is abelian. Notice that the inverse map $i$ is a diffeomorphism and in the case $G$ is abelian, for $X \in \mathfrak{g}$, we have $iX$ is left-invariant and in $\mathfrak{g}$. However at $e \in G$, $d_e i v = -v$ so $iX = -X$, $- [ X,Y] = i[X,Y] = [iX,iY] = [-X,-Y] = [X , Y]$ and $[X,Y] = 0$. You may think that since $G$ is parallelizable and the definition of $v^L$ we have the coefficients of $v^L$ is constant and by $[X,Y] = (XY^i - YX^i)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$<a href="#refer-thm1"><sup>1</sup></a>  we have $[X,Y] = 0 $ without using commutativity. However, this is wrong since in the above quoted theorem the local trivialization is with respect to a local coordinate of the manifold instead of global trivilization of the tangent bundle.</p>
<p>As for general linear group, $\mathrm{Lie}(GL(n,\mathbb{R}))\cong T_{I_n}GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \cong \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ by canonical maps.</p>
<p><strong><big>Induced Lie Algebra Homomorphism</big></strong></p>
<p>A interesting property of Lie algebra of a lie group is that a homomorphism of Lie group induces a homomorphism of a Lie algebra. In large part, the imoprtance of the Lie algebra of a Lie group stems from this fact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> <em>Let $G, H$ be Lie groups, and let $\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{h}$ be their Lie algebras. Suppose $F:G \rightarrow H$ is a Lie group homomorphism. For every $X \in \mathfrak{g}$, there is a unique vector field in $\mathfrak{h}$ that is $F$-related to $X$. With this vector field denoted by</em> $F_* X$, <em>the map</em> $F_* : \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathfrak{h} $ <em>so defined is a Lie akgebra homomorphism.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> In fact $X$ in one of the Lie algebra is uniquely determined by $X\vert e \in T_e$ and $F_*$ induces homomorphism on the tangent space at $e$. From this the proof is easily derived. To check that $F_*$ is well defined, it suffices to check that $(d_eFX\vert_e)^L\vert F(g) = d_gF X\vert_g$. </p>
<p>$$d_gF X\vert_g = d_gF d_eL_g X\vert_e = d_e F\circ L_g X\vert_e = d_e L_{F(g)} d_e F X\vert_e = (d_eFX\vert_e)^L\vert_{F(g)}.$$</p>
<p>The remaining is to check the preserving of brackets. But since if $X, Y$ and $F_* X , F_* Y$ are $F$-related, the naturality of brackets states that $F_*[X,Y] = [F_*X , F_*Y]$. Q.E.D.</p>
<p>In previous section we mentioned the fact that if $G$ is abelian then $iX$ is left-invarient. By the theorem above this derives directly as $i$ is a Lie group homomorphism as $G$ is abelian.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong> $\mathrm{Lie}(H)$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The othorganoal group $O(n)$ is a Lie subgroup of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$. It is euqal to the level set $\Phi^{-1}(I_n)$ where $\Phi(A) = A^TA$. Then $T_{I_n}O(n) = ker(d_{I_n}\Phi)$. However, $d_{I_n}\Phi (B) = B^T + B$. Therefore $T_{I_n}O(n) = ker(d_{I_n}\Phi) = { \text{skew-symmetric $n\times n$ matrics} }$, which is now denoted by $\mathfrak{o}(n)$.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition</strong> Consider $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ as a real Lie group. Then the composition</p>
<p>$$\mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})) \overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow} T_{I_n}\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C}) \overset{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$$</p>
<p>yields a Lie algebra isomorphism between $\mathrm{Lie}\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ and the matrix algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> The result is true if replacing $\mathbb{C}$ by $\mathbb{R}$. However, there is a canonical embedding  $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C}) \overset{\beta}{\hookrightarrow} \mathrm{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$:</p>
<p>$$\left( a_{ij}+b_{ij}i\right) \mapsto \left( \begin{pmatrix} a_{ij} &amp; -b_{ij} \ b_{ij} &amp; a_{ij} \end{pmatrix} \right).$$</p>
<p>We can also consider $\beta$ as a map from $M(n,\mathbb{C})$. Note that $\beta(AB) = \beta(A) \beta(B)$. We also have commutative diagram:</p>
<p>$$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})) @&gt;\epsilon&gt;&gt; T_{I_n}\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})@&gt;\varphi&gt;&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})\ @V{\beta}VV @V{d_{I_n}\beta}VV @V{\alpha}VV\ \mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})) @&gt;\epsilon&gt;&gt;T_{I_{2n}}\mathrm{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})  @&gt;\varphi&gt;&gt; \mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R});\end{CD}$$</p>
<p>where $\alpha$ is properly chosen to let the diagram commutative. $\beta$ is linear so $d_{I_n}\beta$ shares the same behavior as $\beta$, and so is $\alpha$. Therefore $\alpha ([X,Y]) = \alpha(XY)-\alpha(YX) = \alpha(X)\alpha(Y)-\alpha(Y)\alpha(X) = [\alpha(X), \alpha(Y)]$ and $\alpha$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Chasing the diagram then we can make sure $\varphi \circ \epsilon$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism.</p>
<p>We close this chapter by stating a deep algebraic result.</p>

<p><strong><big> Lie Subgroup  </big></strong></p>
<p>A Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a immersed manifold and a subgroup of $G$ that is a Lie group. But there comes the question. When is $H$ a embedded submanifold of $G$, i.e. a smooth submanifold defined in many books on smooth manifold theory. It may be complicated for general smooth manifolds. But with smooth group structure of Lie group we have a simple critirion.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem $7.21$.</strong> <em>$H$ is a Lie subgroup of $G$. Then $H$ is  a embedded iff $H$ is closed.</em></p>
<p><em>proof.</em> Assume $H$ is embedded in $G$ and $h_i \in H \rightarrow g \in G$. Then $h_i^{-1} \rightarrow g^{-1}$. Let $e \in U$ be the domain of a slice chart of $H$ and $e \in W$ be a smaller domain s.t. $\overline{W} \subset U$. So $\overline{W} \cap H$ is a closed and compact set. The multiplication $\varphi : G \times G \rightarrow G$ maps $(g, g^{-1})$ to $e$. So there is a neibourhood $g \in V$ s.t. $\varphi$ maps $V \times V^{-1}$ into $W$ where $V^{-1}$ is the image of $V$ under the inverse map of Lie group. WLOG, assume all $h_i$ are in $V$. We can just fix $j$, and consequently $h_i h_j^{-1} \in \overline{W} \rightarrow g h_j^{-1}$. However, $h_i h_j^{-1} \in \overline{W}\cap H$. So the lmit $g h_j^{-1} \in H$ and $g\in H$. So $H$ is closed.</p>
<p>Conversely, if $H$ is closed. By the translation property of Lie group it suffice to prove that there is a neighbourhood $\bar{U} \subset G$ of some $\bar{h} \in H$ s.t. $\bar{U} \cap H$ is a smooth submanifold of $\bar{U}$. Since $H$ is a immersed submanifold, we can considering the slice chart $U$ centered at $e$. We assume points in $V = U \cap H$ are of coordinate $(x_1,\dots , x_r , 0 , \dots , 0)$ where $r$ is the rank of $H \hookrightarrow G$. Let $S = { (0,\dots  ,0,x_{r+1} , \dots , x_{n}) \in U }$. The derivative of multiplication map  $ \varphi : V \times S \rightarrow U’$ at $0$ is an identity matrix and therefore $\varphi$ is locally diffeomorphism. Shrink the neighbourhood s.t. $\varphi$ is a diffeomorhism. If $\varphi(v,s) \in H \cap U’$ then $vs \in H$ and $s \in H$. Conversely if $s \in H\cap S$ then $\varphi(v,s) = vs \in H$. Therefore $H \cap U’ = V \times H \cap S$. For $h \in H \cap S$ we have $h \in Vh = \varphi(V,h)$ which is a neighbourhood of $h$ in $H$. If $\varphi(v,h)  \in H \cap S$ then $\varphi(v,h) \in Vh \cap S = \varphi ((V, h) \cap (e,S)) = \varphi(e,h)$ and consequently $v = e, \varphi(v,h)=h \in Vh$. Therefore, $H \cap S$ is discrete in $H$ and it is countable. Since $H$ is closed $H \cap S$ is a countable closed subset of $S$. $H \cap S$ is closed implies it is locally compact Hausdorff space and the Baire category theory holds. If $H \cap S$ has no isolated point then every point in it is closed and with empty interior, and the union of them, $H\cap S$, is with empty interior in $H \cap S$, which is absurd. From above there must be an isolated point $\bar{h} \in H \cap S$ and a open set of $S$, $\tilde{U}$ containing $\bar{h}$. Let $\bar{U} = V \times \tilde{U}$, then $H \cap \bar{U} = V\bar{h}$ which is a smooth submanifold of $\bar{U}$. The conclusion follows.</p>
<p><strong><big> Lie Subgroup  </big></strong></p>
<p>An equivariant map $f$ from $M$ to $N$ endowed with Lie group $G$ action, is a map that commute with Lie group action. This along with $G$ being transitive on $M$  is a sufficient condition for a map to have constant rank. This is easily proved by transitive of $G$ on $M$. $\forall x \in M$, let $g\cdot a = m$. Then $Df \circ g(e) = Df(g(e)) Dg(e) = Dgf(e) = Dg(f(e)) Df(e)$ and their ranks are the same. But $g$ is diffeomorphism and $\mathrm{rank}(Df(g(e))Dg(e)) = \mathrm{rank}(Df(x)) = \mathrm{rank}(Dg(f(e)) Df(e)) = \mathrm{rank}(Df(e))$. So the conclusion follows. This is called the <strong><em>Equivariant Rank Theorem</em></strong>. </p>
<p>The concept of equivalent map leads to the <em>orbit map</em>, $\theta^{(p)} : G \rightarrow M$, $\theta^{(p)}(g) = g\cdot p$. This is of course a equivalent map and $G$ acts on $G$ transitively. Therefore $G$ is of constant rank and the inverse image of $p \in M$, the isotropy group of $p$, is a closed Lie subgroup of $G$. </p>
<p>Another important  application of the equivariant rank theorem is to prove the orthognal group is an embedded Lie subgroup of $GL(n)$. We can define a smooth map $\phi : GL(n) \rightarrow M(n), A \mapsto A^{T}A$. Then $O(n) = \phi^{-1}(I)$. Then we only need to check that $\phi$ is a equivariant map. Let $GL(n)$ and on $M(n)$ s.t. $X\cdot A = A^{T}XA$. It is routine to chech that $\phi$ is a equivariant map.</p>
<p>Since the rank is constant, we can compute the dimension of $O(n)$ by computing the rank of $\phi$ at $I$. Consider the curve at $\gamma(t) = I+tB$.</p>
<p>$$d\phi_{I}(B) = \frac{d}{dt}\vert_{t=0}(I+tB)^{T}(I+tB) = B^{T}+B.$$</p>
<p>Hence $Im D\phi = S \subset D_{I}M$ is the symmetric matrices and $rank(\phi) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Therefore $\mathrm{dim}: O(n)= n^2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Similarly you can carry this to the unitary group.</p>
<p><strong><big>Semidirect Products</big></strong></p>
<p>We can define semidirect product on Lie groups. For $\theta : H\times N \rightarrow N$ a smooth left action of $H$ on $N$, if every $\theta_h$ is a group automorphism, we can define $N\rtimes_\theta H $ by $(n,h)(n’,h’) = (n\theta(n’),hh’)$. It is again a Lie group. Just like in general case, if $N,H$ be closed Lie subgroup of $G$ with trivial intersection, $NH = G$ and $N$ is normal, then $G$ is isomorphic to $N \rtimes H$ by action $\theta_h (n) = hnh^{-1}$. Under these hypotheses, we say that $G$ is the internal semidirect product of $N$ and $H$.</p>
<p><strong><big>Representations</big></strong></p>
<p>A representation of a Lie group is a Lie group homomorphism $\rho : G \rightarrow GL(V)$. Note that $G$ acts on $V$ linear iff $G$ act as a representation.</p>
